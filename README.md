# 👗 Generative AI-Powered Fashion Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Generative AI-Powered Fashion Recommendation System is a web-based application that provides personalized outfit recommendations based on user preferences such as occasion, style, season, and budget.

This system leverages Generative AI concepts to dynamically generate customized outfit combinations instead of simply filtering predefined products.
